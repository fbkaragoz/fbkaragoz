### Currently building
- **Mapfluencer** — analytics automation for influencer–brand compatibility scoring
- **ROTA** — adaptive AI systems for human-centered learning and guidance

### Focus areas
- Retrieval-augmented generation pipelines for knowledge-dense corpora  
- Agentic systems that keep research, data, and product feedback aligned  
- MLOps patterns that make NLP models observable and reliable in production  

### Toolbox
`Python` `PyTorch` `Transformers` `LangChain` `Weights & Biases` `PostgreSQL` `pgvector` `WebGL`

### What I care about next
- Knowledge graphs that combine private and public data streams  
- Practical human-and-model collaboration patterns in analytics teams
